function f = pipe_friction_factor(Re, d, eps)
    % Version 20210729 JvH
    %    minor correction: Y2 = logfactor rather than Y2=log(logfactor)
    %        makes negligible difference
    %    Note that the use of log10 for Re>4000, while using log for
    %        2000<Re<4000 is correct 
    % Jeroen van Hunen, 20190505
    % This function calculates the friction factor for flow in a pipe.
    % From EPANET 2 manual (2000), App.D, p.189.
    % Arguments: 
    %  Re = Reynolds nr
    %  d = pipe diameter (m or ft)
    %  eps = Darcy-Weisbach roughness coefficient (m or ft)
    % Note that both d and eps can be in either m or ft, but the same unit
    %    must be used for both.
    
    %Re = max(Re, 100);  % avoid dividing by zero for zero flow

    if Re<2000
        % laminar regime:
        f=64/Re;
    elseif Re>4000
        % turbulent regime, Swameeâ€“Jain equation (from Bhave, 1991):
        % Note that, unlike stated in EPANET manual, the log used in (only)
        %   this formula should be a log10, not an ln, hence the log(10)^2 
        %   to compensate for that. 
        lf = logfactor(Re, d, eps);
        f = 0.25 / log10(lf)^2; 
        %f = 0.25 / log(lf)^2; 
    else
        % intermediate regime (Dunlop. 1991):
        R  = Re/2000;
        Y2 = logfactor(Re, d, eps);
